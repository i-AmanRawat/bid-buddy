- **When you have complex or critical environment variable needs**: If your project relies heavily on environment variables and you want to ensure they are handled correctly, this package can be very helpful.

### What is the use of Adapters in NextAuth?

- In NextAuth.js, an Adapter is a crucial component that allows you to connect your authentication system to different databases or data storage solutions. By default, NextAuth.js stores user data (e.g., users, sessions, accounts, verification tokens) in memory, which is not persistent. To store this data in a database like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or any other supported database, you need an Adapter.

- **Handling Multiple Accounts**: If your application supports multiple authentication providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub), Adapters manage linking these external accounts to a single user profile in your database.
